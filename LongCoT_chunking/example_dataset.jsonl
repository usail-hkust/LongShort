Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to express x, y, z in terms of each other or find some relationships between them using the given equations.\n\nLet me recall that logarithms can be converted into exponential form, which might make it easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that to each equation:\n\n1. From the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2 ⇒ 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, x = 2^(1/2) * y * z. Let me write that as x = √2 * y * z.\n\n2. Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3 ⇒ 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). So, y = 2^(1/3) * x * z.\n\n3. The third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4 ⇒ 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). So, z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nAlright, so now I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of the other variables. Let me write them again:\n\nx = √2 * y * z,\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x * z,\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. Maybe I can substitute one into another to reduce the number of variables.\n\nLet me try substituting x from the first equation into the second equation.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * (√2 * y * z) * z.\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * √2 * y * z².\n\nLet me compute 2^(1/3) * √2. Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so multiplying them together gives 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6).\n\nSo, y = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me write that:\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\n\nI can divide both sides by y, assuming y ≠ 0, which it isn't because it's a positive real number. So:\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z².\n\nSo, solving for z²: z² = 1 / 2^(5/6).\n\nTherefore, z = 1 / (2^(5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12).\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nz² = 1 / 2^(5/6) ⇒ z = (1 / 2^(5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me write that as z = 2^(-5/12) or 1 / 2^(5/12). Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's see. Maybe I can find y now.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nWe have z expressed in terms of x and y, but we also have x in terms of y and z. Let me try plugging in the value of z and x into this equation.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\n\nSo, substitute x and z into equation 3:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * (√2 * y * z) * y.\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * √2 * y² * z.\n\nCompute 2^(1/4) * √2. Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/4) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(3/4).\n\nSo, z = 2^(3/4) * y² * z.\n\nHmm, so z = 2^(3/4) * y² * z.\n\nWait, that's similar to the previous step. Let me subtract 2^(3/4) * y² * z from both sides:\n\nz - 2^(3/4) * y² * z = 0.\n\nFactor out z:\n\nz (1 - 2^(3/4) * y²) = 0.\n\nSince z is positive, z ≠ 0, so 1 - 2^(3/4) * y² = 0 ⇒ 2^(3/4) * y² = 1 ⇒ y² = 1 / 2^(3/4).\n\nTherefore, y = (1 / 2^(3/4))^(1/2) = 2^(-3/8).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\ny² = 1 / 2^(3/4) ⇒ y = (1 / 2^(3/4))^(1/2) = 2^(-3/8). That's correct.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, moving on. Now that I have y, can I find x?\n\nFrom equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\n\nWe have y = 2^(-3/8) and z = 2^(-5/12). So,\n\nx = √2 * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12).\n\nFirst, let me express √2 as 2^(1/2).\n\nSo, 2^(1/2) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12).\n\nAdding the exponents:\n\n1/2 + (-3/8) + (-5/12).\n\nLet me convert them to 24 denominators:\n\n1/2 = 12/24,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\n-5/12 = -10/24.\n\nSo, total exponent: 12 - 9 -10 = -7/24.\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nAlright, so now I have x, y, z expressed as:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me double-check these values to make sure they satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst, let's compute x/(y z):\n\nx/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nCombine the exponents in the denominator:\n\n-3/8 + (-5/12) = (-9/24 -10/24) = -19/24.\n\nSo, denominator is 2^(-19/24).\n\nThus, x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = √2.\n\nWhich matches the first equation, since log₂(√2) = 1/2. Good.\n\nNow, let's check the second equation: y/(x z).\n\nCompute y/(x z) = [2^(-3/8)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nDenominator exponents: -7/24 + (-5/12) = -7/24 -10/24 = -17/24.\n\nSo, denominator is 2^(-17/24).\n\nThus, y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-3/8 + 17/24).\n\nConvert -3/8 to -9/24:\n\n-9/24 +17/24 = 8/24 = 1/3.\n\nSo, y/(x z) = 2^(1/3), which matches the second equation. Good.\n\nThird equation: z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)].\n\nDenominator exponents: -7/24 + (-3/8) = -7/24 -9/24 = -16/24 = -2/3.\n\nSo, denominator is 2^(-2/3).\n\nThus, z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 2/3).\n\nConvert 2/3 to 8/12:\n\n-5/12 + 8/12 = 3/12 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, z/(x y) = 2^(1/4). Perfect, that's the third equation.\n\nSo, all three equations are satisfied. Great, so the values for x, y, z are correct.\n\nNow, the question is to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.\n\nLet me compute x⁴ y³ z².\n\nSince x, y, z are all expressed as powers of 2, I can handle this by adding exponents.\n\nx⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6),\n\ny³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8),\n\nz² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6).\n\nMultiply them all together:\n\nx⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).\n\nAdding the exponents:\n\n-7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6).\n\nFirst, let me find a common denominator. 24 perhaps.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding them: -28 -27 -20 = -75/24.\n\nSo, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-75/24).\n\nWait, 2^(-75/24). Hmm, can I simplify that?\n\n75 and 24 have a common factor of 3: 75 = 25*3, 24=8*3.\n\nSo, 75/24 = 25/8.\n\nSo, 2^(-75/24) = 2^(-25/8).\n\nSo, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8).\n\nTherefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nSo, the absolute value |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)| = | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nTherefore, m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. So, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my exponent arithmetic.\n\nCompute x⁴ y³ z²:\n\nx⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6),\n\ny³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8),\n\nz² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6).\n\nSo, exponents:\n\n-7/6, -9/8, -5/6. Let me add them again.\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -75/24.\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8.\n\nYes, so 2^(-25/8). Taking log base 2, gives -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8. So, yeah, 25/8 is correct.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8, which are coprime. So, m +n=33.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{33}\n</think>\n\nGiven the system of equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nWe convert each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\\) implies \\(x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\\) implies \\(y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\\) implies \\(z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy\\)\n\nWe substitute \\(x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot (\\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz) \\cdot z\\]\n\\[y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz^2\\]\n\\[y = 2^{5/6} \\cdot yz^2\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(y\\):\n\\[1 = 2^{5/6} \\cdot z^2\\]\n\\[z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\\]\n\\[z = 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\nNext, substitute \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} \\cdot x \\cdot y\\]\n\\[2^{-5/12} = 2^{3/4} \\cdot xy\\]\n\\[2^{-5/12 - 3/4} = x\\]\n\\[x = 2^{-5/12 - 9/12} = 2^{-14/12} = 2^{-7/6}\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(x = 2^{-7/6}\\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[2^{-7/6} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot y \\cdot 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\\[2^{-7/6} = 2^{1/2} \\cdot y \\cdot 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\\[2^{-7/6 - 1/2 + 5/12} = y\\]\nConvert to a common denominator:\n\\[2^{-14/12 - 6/12 + 5/12} = y\\]\n\\[2^{-15/12} = y\\]\n\\[y = 2^{-5/4}\\]\n\nFinally, we need to find \\(|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\\):\n\nCalculate \\(x^4 y^3 z^2\\):\n\\[x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}\\]\n\\[y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}\\]\n\\[z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}\\]\n\nCombine these:\n\\[x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \\cdot 2^{-9/8} \\cdot 2^{-5/6}\\]\nAdd the exponents:\n\\[-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8\\]\nThus,\n\\[\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \\log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -25/8\\]\nTaking the absolute value:\n\\[|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8\\]\n\nThe value is \\(\\frac{25}{8}\\), so \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\).
