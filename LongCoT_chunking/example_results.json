        "thought": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of three logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to express x, y, z in terms of each other or find some relationships between them using the given equations.\n\nLet me recall that logarithms can be converted into exponential form, which might make it easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that to each equation:\n\n1. From the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2 ⇒ 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, x = 2^(1/2) * y * z. Let me write that as x = √2 * y * z.\n\n2. Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3 ⇒ 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). So, y = 2^(1/3) * x * z.\n\n3. The third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4 ⇒ 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). So, z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nAlright, so now I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of the other variables. Let me write them again:\n\nx = √2 * y * z,\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x * z,\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. Maybe I can substitute one into another to reduce the number of variables.\n\nLet me try substituting x from the first equation into the second equation.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * (√2 * y * z) * z.\n\nSimplify that:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * √2 * y * z².\n\nLet me compute 2^(1/3) * √2. Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so multiplying them together gives 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6).\n\nSo, y = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me write that:\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\n\nI can divide both sides by y, assuming y ≠ 0, which it isn't because it's a positive real number. So:\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z².\n\nSo, solving for z²: z² = 1 / 2^(5/6).\n\nTherefore, z = 1 / (2^(5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12).\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nz² = 1 / 2^(5/6) ⇒ z = (1 / 2^(5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me write that as z = 2^(-5/12) or 1 / 2^(5/12). Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's see. Maybe I can find y now.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\n\nWe have z expressed in terms of x and y, but we also have x in terms of y and z. Let me try plugging in the value of z and x into this equation.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\n\nSo, substitute x and z into equation 3:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * (√2 * y * z) * y.\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * √2 * y² * z.\n\nCompute 2^(1/4) * √2. Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/4) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(3/4).\n\nSo, z = 2^(3/4) * y² * z.\n\nHmm, so z = 2^(3/4) * y² * z.\n\nWait, that's similar to the previous step. Let me subtract 2^(3/4) * y² * z from both sides:\n\nz - 2^(3/4) * y² * z = 0.\n\nFactor out z:\n\nz (1 - 2^(3/4) * y²) = 0.\n\nSince z is positive, z ≠ 0, so 1 - 2^(3/4) * y² = 0 ⇒ 2^(3/4) * y² = 1 ⇒ y² = 1 / 2^(3/4).\n\nTherefore, y = (1 / 2^(3/4))^(1/2) = 2^(-3/8).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\ny² = 1 / 2^(3/4) ⇒ y = (1 / 2^(3/4))^(1/2) = 2^(-3/8). That's correct.\n\nSo, y = 2^(-3/8).\n\nNow, moving on. Now that I have y, can I find x?\n\nFrom equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\n\nWe have y = 2^(-3/8) and z = 2^(-5/12). So,\n\nx = √2 * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12).\n\nFirst, let me express √2 as 2^(1/2).\n\nSo, 2^(1/2) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12).\n\nAdding the exponents:\n\n1/2 + (-3/8) + (-5/12).\n\nLet me convert them to 24 denominators:\n\n1/2 = 12/24,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\n-5/12 = -10/24.\n\nSo, total exponent: 12 - 9 -10 = -7/24.\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nAlright, so now I have x, y, z expressed as:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nLet me double-check these values to make sure they satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst, let's compute x/(y z):\n\nx/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nCombine the exponents in the denominator:\n\n-3/8 + (-5/12) = (-9/24 -10/24) = -19/24.\n\nSo, denominator is 2^(-19/24).\n\nThus, x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = √2.\n\nWhich matches the first equation, since log₂(√2) = 1/2. Good.\n\nNow, let's check the second equation: y/(x z).\n\nCompute y/(x z) = [2^(-3/8)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\n\nDenominator exponents: -7/24 + (-5/12) = -7/24 -10/24 = -17/24.\n\nSo, denominator is 2^(-17/24).\n\nThus, y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-3/8 + 17/24).\n\nConvert -3/8 to -9/24:\n\n-9/24 +17/24 = 8/24 = 1/3.\n\nSo, y/(x z) = 2^(1/3), which matches the second equation. Good.\n\nThird equation: z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)].\n\nDenominator exponents: -7/24 + (-3/8) = -7/24 -9/24 = -16/24 = -2/3.\n\nSo, denominator is 2^(-2/3).\n\nThus, z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 2/3).\n\nConvert 2/3 to 8/12:\n\n-5/12 + 8/12 = 3/12 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, z/(x y) = 2^(1/4). Perfect, that's the third equation.\n\nSo, all three equations are satisfied. Great, so the values for x, y, z are correct.\n\nNow, the question is to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.\n\nLet me compute x⁴ y³ z².\n\nSince x, y, z are all expressed as powers of 2, I can handle this by adding exponents.\n\nx⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6),\n\ny³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8),\n\nz² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6).\n\nMultiply them all together:\n\nx⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).\n\nAdding the exponents:\n\n-7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6).\n\nFirst, let me find a common denominator. 24 perhaps.\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding them: -28 -27 -20 = -75/24.\n\nSo, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-75/24).\n\nWait, 2^(-75/24). Hmm, can I simplify that?\n\n75 and 24 have a common factor of 3: 75 = 25*3, 24=8*3.\n\nSo, 75/24 = 25/8.\n\nSo, 2^(-75/24) = 2^(-25/8).\n\nSo, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8).\n\nTherefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nSo, the absolute value |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)| = | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nTherefore, m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. So, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my exponent arithmetic.\n\nCompute x⁴ y³ z²:\n\nx⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6),\n\ny³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8),\n\nz² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6).\n\nSo, exponents:\n\n-7/6, -9/8, -5/6. Let me add them again.\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -75/24.\n\nSimplify: -75/24 = -25/8.\n\nYes, so 2^(-25/8). Taking log base 2, gives -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8. So, yeah, 25/8 is correct.\n\nTherefore, m =25, n=8, which are coprime. So, m +n=33.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{33}\n</think>\n\nGiven the system of equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nWe convert each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\\) implies \\(x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\\) implies \\(y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\\) implies \\(z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy\\)\n\nWe substitute \\(x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot (\\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz) \\cdot z\\]\n\\[y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz^2\\]\n\\[y = 2^{5/6} \\cdot yz^2\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(y\\):\n\\[1 = 2^{5/6} \\cdot z^2\\]\n\\[z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\\]\n\\[z = 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\nNext, substitute \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} \\cdot x \\cdot y\\]\n\\[2^{-5/12} = 2^{3/4} \\cdot xy\\]\n\\[2^{-5/12 - 3/4} = x\\]\n\\[x = 2^{-5/12 - 9/12} = 2^{-14/12} = 2^{-7/6}\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(x = 2^{-7/6}\\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[2^{-7/6} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot y \\cdot 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\\[2^{-7/6} = 2^{1/2} \\cdot y \\cdot 2^{-5/12}\\]\n\\[2^{-7/6 - 1/2 + 5/12} = y\\]\nConvert to a common denominator:\n\\[2^{-14/12 - 6/12 + 5/12} = y\\]\n\\[2^{-15/12} = y\\]\n\\[y = 2^{-5/4}\\]\n\nFinally, we need to find \\(|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\\):\n\nCalculate \\(x^4 y^3 z^2\\):\n\\[x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}\\]\n\\[y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}\\]\n\\[z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}\\]\n\nCombine these:\n\\[x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \\cdot 2^{-9/8} \\cdot 2^{-5/6}\\]\nAdd the exponents:\n\\[-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8\\]\nThus,\n\\[\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \\log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -25/8\\]\nTaking the absolute value:\n\\[|\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8\\]\n\nThe value is \\(\\frac{25}{8}\\), so \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\).

Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\nStep 2: First, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\nStep 3: 1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4\nStep 4: And I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to express x, y, z in terms of each other or find some relationships between them using the given equations.\nStep 5: Let me recall that logarithms can be converted into exponential form, which might make it easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that to each equation:\nStep 6: 1. From the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2 ⇒ 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, x = 2^(1/2) * y * z. Let me write that as x = √2 * y * z.\nStep 7: 2. Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3 ⇒ 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). So, y = 2^(1/3) * x * z.\nStep 8: 3. The third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4 ⇒ 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). So, z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\nStep 9: Alright, so now I have expressions for x, y, z in terms of the other variables. Let me write them again:\nStep 10: x = √2 * y * z,\nStep 11: y = 2^(1/3) * x * z,\nStep 12: z = 2^(1/4) * x * y.\nStep 13: Hmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two. Maybe I can substitute one into another to reduce the number of variables.\nStep 14: Let me try substituting x from the first equation into the second equation.\nStep 15: From equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\nStep 16: Substitute into equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * (√2 * y * z) * z.\nStep 17: Simplify that:\nStep 18: y = 2^(1/3) * √2 * y * z².\nStep 19: Let me compute 2^(1/3) * √2. Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so multiplying them together gives 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6).\nStep 20: So, y = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\nStep 21: Hmm, let's see. Let me write that:\nStep 22: y = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\nStep 23: I can divide both sides by y, assuming y ≠ 0, which it isn't because it's a positive real number. So:\nStep 24: 1 = 2^(5/6) * z².\nStep 25: So, solving for z²: z² = 1 / 2^(5/6).\nStep 26: Therefore, z = 1 / (2^(5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12).\nStep 27: Wait, let me verify that:\nStep 28: z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) ⇒ z = (1 / 2^(5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12). Yeah, that's correct.\nStep 29: So, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me write that as z = 2^(-5/12) or 1 / 2^(5/12). Hmm, okay.\nStep 30: Now, let's see.

Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/4) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(3/4).\nStep 39: So, z = 2^(3/4) * y² * z.\nStep 40: Hmm, so z = 2^(3/4) * y² * z.\nStep 41: Wait, that's similar to the previous step. Let me subtract 2^(3/4) * y² * z from both sides:\nStep 42: z - 2^(3/4) * y² * z = 0.\nStep 43: Factor out z:\nStep 44: z (1 - 2^(3/4) * y²) = 0.\nStep 45: Since z is positive, z ≠ 0, so 1 - 2^(3/4) * y² = 0 ⇒ 2^(3/4) * y² = 1 ⇒ y² = 1 / 2^(3/4).\nStep 46: Therefore, y = (1 / 2^(3/4))^(1/2) = 2^(-3/8).\nStep 47: Wait, let me check:\nStep 48: y² = 1 / 2^(3/4) ⇒ y = (1 / 2^(3/4))^(1/2) = 2^(-3/8). That's correct.\nStep 49: So, y = 2^(-3/8).\nStep 50: Now, moving on. Now that I have y, can I find x?\nStep 51: From equation 1: x = √2 * y * z.\nStep 52: We have y = 2^(-3/8) and z = 2^(-5/12). So,\nStep 53: x = √2 * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12).\nStep 54: First, let me express √2 as 2^(1/2).\nStep 55: So, 2^(1/2) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12).\nStep 56: Adding the exponents:\nStep 57: 1/2 + (-3/8) + (-5/12).\nStep 58: Let me convert them to 24 denominators:\nStep 59: 1/2 = 12/24,\nStep 60: -3/8 = -9/24,\nStep 61: -5/12 = -10/24.\nStep 62: So, total exponent: 12 - 9 -10 = -7/24.\nStep 63: Therefore, x = 2^(-7/24).\nStep 64: So, x = 2^(-7/24).\nStep 65: Alright, so now I have x, y, z expressed as:\nStep 66: x = 2^(-7/24),\nStep 67: y = 2^(-3/8),\nStep 68: z = 2^(-5/12).\nStep 69: Let me double-check these values to make sure they satisfy the original equations.\nStep 70: First, let's compute x/(y z):\nStep 71: x/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)].\nStep 72: Combine the exponents in the denominator:\nStep 73: -3/8 + (-5/12) = (-9/24 -10/24) = -19/24.\nStep 74: So, denominator is 2^(-19/24).\nStep 75: Thus, x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2) = √2.\nStep 76: Which matches the first equation, since log₂(√2) = 1/2. Good.\nStep 77: Now, let's check the second equation: y/(x z).\nStep 78: Compute y/(x z) = [2^(-3/8)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)].\nStep 79: Denominator exponents: -7/24 + (-5/12) = -7/24 -10/24 = -17/24.\nStep 80: So, denominator is 2^(-17/24).\nStep 81: Thus, y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-3/8 + 17/24).\nStep 82: Convert -3/8 to -9/24:\nStep 83: -9/24 +17/24 = 8/24 = 1/3.\nStep 84: So, y/(x z) = 2^(1/3), which matches the second equation. Good.\nStep 85: Third equation: z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)].\nStep 86: Denominator exponents: -7/24 + (-3/8) = -7/24 -9/24 = -16/24 = -2/3.\nStep 87: So, denominator is 2^(-2/3).\nStep 88: Thus, z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 2/3).\nStep 89: Convert 2/3 to 8/12:\nStep 90: -5/12 + 8/12 = 3/12 = 1/4.\nStep 91: Therefore, z/(x y) = 2^(1/4).

They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. So, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\nStep 117: Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my exponent arithmetic.\nStep 118: Compute x⁴ y³ z²:\nStep 119: x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/6),\nStep 120: y³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8),\nStep 121: z² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6).\nStep 122: So, exponents:\nStep 123: -7/6, -9/8, -5/6. Let me add them again.\nStep 124: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\nStep 125: Convert to 24 denominators:\nStep 126: -7/6 = -28/24,\nStep 127: -9/8 = -27/24,\nStep 128: -5/6 = -20/24.\nStep 129: Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -75/24.\nStep 130: Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8.\nStep 131: Yes, so 2^(-25/8). Taking log base 2, gives -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8. So, yeah, 25/8 is correct.\nStep 132: Therefore, m =25, n=8, which are coprime.

Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to express x, y, z in terms of each other or find some relationships between them using the given equations.",
            "block 2": "Let me recall that logarithms can be converted into exponential form, which might make it easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that to each equation:\n\n1. From the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2 ⇒ 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, x = 2^(1/2) * y * z. Let me write that as x = √2 * y * z.\n\n2. Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3 ⇒ 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). So, y = 2^(1/3) * x * z.\n\n3. The third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4 ⇒ 2^(1/4) = z / (x y).

Since √2 is 2^(1/2), so multiplying them together gives 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6).\n\nSo, y = 2^(5/6) * y * z².\n\nHmm, let's see.
